                    Artist turned web developer.<br />
                    That's exactly what happened a couple of years ago. A transformation that didn't happen overnight,
                    but a process that gradually evolved over the years.
                    The trigger that set it all in motion was the declining level of satisfaction I was experiencing for
                    some years in making art.<br />
                    <span className={style.fade1}>Different from any artistic crisis I experienced over the years something was undermining the very
                    foundation of making art and being an artist.Wrestling with the bare essence of oneself.</span><br />
                    <span className={style.fade}>The outcome of the fight would soon be evident. No winner, no loser but a clear insight.
                    I decided to make a U-turn and retrain myself to become a so called self-taught web developer.</span><br /><br />
                    <span className={style.fade2}>Coming from a artistic background, teaching yourself to code without any prior knowledge, without a mentor
                    is a time consuming enterprise with a relatively steep learning curve, depending on your background ofcourse.</span><br/>
                    <span className={style.fade3}>But the goal I set myself was clear, become a so called self-taught web developer.</span><br /><br />
